# Palestinian Flag with Python Turtle Graphics

This Python program uses the Turtle graphics library to draw the flag of Palestine. The flag consists of three horizontal stripes of black, white, and green colors, with a red triangle on the hoist side. The flag's proportions are approximate, and the colors represent the Palestinian national flag.

## Instructions

1. **Requirements**: Ensure that you have Python and the Turtle graphics library installed.

2. **Run the Script**: Open the script using your preferred Python environment, such as VS Code, and run it. The script will create a window displaying the Palestinian flag.

3. **Flag Dimensions**: The flag's dimensions and colors are defined in the script and can be adjusted as needed.

4. **Customization**: You can modify the script to change the flag's proportions or colors to fit your preferences.

## Usage

You can use this script to visualize and experiment with drawing the Palestinian flag using Python's Turtle graphics library.

```python
# To run the script, simply execute it using your Python environment.
python palestinFlag.py
```

**Example Output**
Here is an example of the Palestinian flag generated by the script:
